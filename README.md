# Predict fROIs from Connectivity
todo1 (sufficient for anyone computationally savvy):
get models in paper order
include julian parcels

todo2:
write script to apply models, assuming functional connectivity is computed and in correct order

todo3:
write script to compute functional connectivity and wrap it all together

# Predict fROIs from Connectivity
Github repository to accompany "Predicting High-level Visual Areas in the Absence of Task fMRI" by Molloy, Saygin & Osher (under review). 

## Version 1: release of final trained model 

The repository currently contains the search spaces from Julian et al. 2011 and the final trained model from Molloy et al. (under review) sufficient for anyone computationally savvy to predict high-level visual fROIs from their own resting state data. 


todo2:

-write script to apply models, assuming functional connectivity is computed and in correct order

todo3:

-write script to compute functional connectivity and wrap it all together
